        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p><strong>Do we need to bring anything?</strong><br>
             It is highly suggested you bring polarized sunglasses, sunscreen, snacks, and anything else you might need for a long day on the water.</p>
      
          <p><strong>Do we need fishing experience?</strong><br>
             Prior experience is always good, but you donâ€™t have to have ever even stepped foot on a boat. We will get you comfortable and ready to fight the fish of a lifetime.</p>
      
          <p><strong>Do we need a fishing license?</strong><br>
             In the state of South Carolina, as long as the vessel is registered through the Coast Guard, you do not need a license.</p>
